# What is this?
This is a collection of my solutions to Google Foobar.

# What is Google Foobar?
Google foobar is an invite only timed programming challenge by Google which gets progressively harder as it goes.

# Why doesn't the code work?
This is not a project file, its just the raw source I have, sometimes the one I submitted, sometimes just the ones I had saved on my local computer. I couldn't be bothered to organize them any better as once you submit a solution you can't do it again or even see the question again. I also did these spread out over a long time (longer than a year so far), which includes three different OS installs, so there is very little consistency.
